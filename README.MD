# Amazing personal kakrc.

The title says it. It should specially perform in the likes of spacemacs (the space pressing rocks!) and keeping some vim-kak attitude. All warranties void!

# Using

Just do: 
`mkdir -p ~/.config/kak && git clone https://github.com/jordaorodolfo/SuperKarona.git ~/.config/kak`
